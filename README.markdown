This is a simple Unity indicator - it just tells you every hour or so to take a break.

To install follow these steps:

* 'cd watch-your-breaks'
* `bundle install`
* To get icons you have to copy icons into `/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/status` and then as root run `update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/`. TODO: fix this
